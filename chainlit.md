# Improving Accessibility to Healthcare: Developing an Advanced LLM-Based AI Chatbot

Chatbots are computer programs that identify sentence keywords and make query
decisions. The use of chatbots in the medical industry has grown significantly in recent
years, revolutionizing patient support, healthcare interactions, and the dissemination of
medical information. A medical chatbot that can recognize illnesses and provide basic
information about them is to be created using artificial intelligence. This will lower
healthcare costs and increase the availability of medical information. Ranking and
sentence similarity calculation is performed using n-grams. TFIDF and cosine similarity
using the LangChain model. For the given query, more similar sentences are obtained,
and a score is obtained for each sentence in the input sentence.
